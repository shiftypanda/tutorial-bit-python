Hey there, this is a mass DM going out to everyone who is willing to start working on the MIT course.  We just need to ask a few questions in order to group everyone up as best we can.

What would you say your skill level is? (0-4):

* 0 = Complete beginner
* 1 = Basic knowledge of logic and some programming techniques
* 2 = Fluent in a different programming language
* 3 = Fluent in multiple different programming languages
* 4 = Programming veteran

What timezone applies to you? (Relative to UTC)

Is there anyone in the chat that you'd like to share a group with?

Thanks for joining us in this course, good luck to you!
